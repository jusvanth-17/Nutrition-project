            <p>
                Fruits are the mature ovaries of flowering plants, typically containing seeds. They develop from fertilized flowers and 
                serve as a means for the plant to disperse its seeds. Fruits come in various forms, such as berries, drupes, and pomes, 
                and they are often characterized by their sweet or savory taste. In addition to being a source of nutrition for humans 
                and animals, fruits play a crucial role in the reproductive cycle of plants, facilitating the spread and germination of 
                seeds.
